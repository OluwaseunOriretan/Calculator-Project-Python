This project is a simple calculator program implemented in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to choose an operation and input two numbers, then returns the result of the chosen operation. Each operation is modularized into separate functions, making the code clean, easy to understand, and reusable. This project is ideal for beginners learning about Python functions, user input, and basic control flow structures like conditionals.
